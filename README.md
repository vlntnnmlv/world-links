This is my final work studying in Financial university under the Government of Russian Fedeartion on the Big Data Analysis department.
The goal of this project is to simulate world logistics, using open-source datasources.

In particualar, the events of the last days are interesting to simulate and see what impact these events will have on the future of world economics.

### Problematics

Logisitc systems are much more important than they may seem. Nowadays at the time of globalization and labor division, even the simplest product is being composed of many simple parts. For example, such a simple thing as an chicken egg, has a long way from the farm to the product store.
First off all we need a chicken to be born, which will 'give' us a n egg. If we want the egg to be tasty and big, this chicken have to be properly raised and fed. Also modern technics of animal husbandary often uses medicine to make chickens stronger and healthier. After eggs being produced by chickens, all of them are sorted and partioned in groups. Then obviously, the egg is shipped to the warehouse, and to the store. Concurently, the packages for eggs are produced, also via long chain of actions.
In the end we have such a graph of egg production:

Chick + Medicine + Food + Human Labor = Chicken + Cock = Egg + Human Labor + Package = Egg in the store.
